DISCLAIMER: this tutorial is based on Maximillian's React [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/l).
Note: React hooks supported in version > 16.
As far as i know the standard today is to use react hooks instead of split the app to functional and class based components.
